A plugin of Races, stats, classes and abilities for Minecraft 1.20.1.
The foundations of plugin is a stats. 
It has 8 different stats: Constitution, Defense, Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Luck and Charisma.
Each one do one different thing, except Charisma, not yet implemented.

At the moment has 5 races: Soul, Human, Elf, Orc and Dwarf, though soul do nothing.

Any help or suggestion is welcome, even of names or programming.
My main language is Spanish, así que me es más fácil de entender este idioma. 
And i am new in the programming.

Future plans:
- Classes and more abilities.
- Scaling level for races and classes.
- Unique items for races and classes.
- More races for different setups.
